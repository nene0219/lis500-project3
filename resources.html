        <h1>Resources on Implicit Bias and Intersectionality</h1>
        <p>Implicit bias refers to unconscious attitudes or stereotypes that influence our decisions and interactions,
            often without awareness. The Implicit Bias Test (IBT) helps uncover these hidden biases, encouraging
            self-reflection. Intersectionality, coined by Kimberlé Crenshaw, highlights how overlapping identities, such
            as race, gender, and class, shape unique experiences of privilege and discrimination. Explore the resources
            below to deepen your understanding.</p>

        <h3>What is the Harvard IAT?</h3>
        <p>The Harvard IAT measures the strength of associations between concepts and stereotypes, such as linking
            “women” with “family” versus “men” with “career.”</p>
        <h3>Discussion</h3>
        <p>The creators use “automatic preference” to describe results, avoiding definitive labels of bias or racism. A

            noted the lack of disclaimers about its predictive limits, though recent updates clarify that a single test
            doesn't forecast behavior. While its effectiveness is debated, the IAT prompts valuable introspection on
            hidden biases.</p>

        <h3>Discussion Guide for "White Fragility" by Robin DiAngelo</h3>
        <a href="https://canvas.wisc.edu/courses/447310/files/43662701?wrap=1" class="resource-button">Read Guide</a>
        <p>This guide offers instructions for leading discussions on white fragility with white groups, addressing
            resistance and hopelessness. DiAngelo emphasizes: “The primary goal for white people working to understand
            racism is not to learn how racism impacts people of color. The primary goal is to recognize how the system
            of racism shapes our lives,
            how we uphold that system, and how we might interrupt it.”</p>
        <h3>Ben Shapiro's Take on Intersectionality</h3>
        <a href="https://canvas.wisc.edu/courses/447310/files/43662509?wrap=1" class="resource-button">Read Article</a>
        <p>Shapiro's critique presents a pessimistic view of intersectionality, illustrating how the concept can be
            misconstrued and negatively portrayed.</p>
