            <h1>Lisa Su</h1>
            <p class="ttext">Lisa Su is a woman leader and role model in technology, especially for women and people of
                color. She has helped AMD, as its CEO, to advance in a field traditionally dominated by men. Her work in
                developing processors and graphic processing units proves that innovation and technical expertise have
                nothing to do with gender or racial boundaries.</p>
            <p class="ttext">By speaking at industry events, mentoring young professionals, and supporting diversity
                initiatives, she inspires more women and underrepresented minorities to pursue careers in tech. Her
                commitment to creating an inclusive environment not only drives change at AMD but also makes a
                meaningful impact on the tech industry as a whole.</p>
            <p class="ttext">Lisa Su has consistently appeared on lists of the most powerful women in business for
                several years, underscoring her significant influence. As a role model for women in STEM, she has
                further demonstrated her dedication by helping to establish a fellowship fund at MIT to support women
                graduate students in nanotechnology.</p>
            <p class="ttext">Through her leadership and advocacy, Lisa Su continues to pave the way for a more inclusive
                future in technology.</p>

            <h1>Christopher Gray</h1>
            <p class="ttext">My current tech hero is Christopher Gray, the founder of scholarship finder app Scholly.
                Gray had to do extensive research in the library to find scholarships to fund his college education and
                wanted to utilize tech to make scholarships easier to find. He recognized that a large portion of
                students aren't aware of the scholarships they're eligible for, and how student debt can be particularly
                harmful for people of color.</p>
            <p class="ttext">He hopes that by easing access to scholarships, more Black students will graduate with tech
                degrees, and are given tools to help break cycles of generational poverty. His social entrepreneurship
                has put him on the Forbes 30 under 30 list, and he is an active contributor to the magazine. Scholly has
                been acquired by Sallie Mae as of 2023, which allowed it to be provided for free, increasing access to
                the service.</p>
            <p class="ttext">I work/volunteer for Matriculate, a non-profit matching college students with high
                achieving, low income high school seniors for free college application advising. Seeing Gray use
                technology to increase educational equity is very inspirational to me and many others, undoubtedly.</p>
