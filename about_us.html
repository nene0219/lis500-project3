                <p>Hi, I'm a junior studing Graphic Design and Information Science. I'm currently obsessed with matcha
                    lattes and I love to draw and paint. As someone who grew up as an artist on the internet, I've
                    always been interested in how bias has been encoded into the social media platforms I spend so much
                    time on. I look forward to hearing more from underrepresented voices in tech.</p>

                <h2>Haku</h2>
                <p>Hello! I’m Haku, and I’m a senior majoring in Computer Science. I love traveling to new places and
                    trying different foods because it allows me to immerse myself in different cultures. I think that
                    traveling broadens one’s perspective, and the same curiosity applies to my interest in technology
                    and its broader impact on society.
                    I decided to take this class because I’ve never really thought about the connection between code and
                    power, and I’m excited to learn how they intersect. Since I have spent years learning how to write
                    code and optimize technology, I haven’t paid much attention to the social and political structures
                    that shape the tech industry itself. I am particularly interested in learning how race, class, and
                    gender influence opportunities in the tech industry. As someone who hopes to work in the tech
                    industry, I think it is important to understand these dynamics.</p>
